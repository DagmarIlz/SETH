Datasets used to train and test SETH. The test set is identical to the set uploaded alongside ODiNPred [[1]](#1). The training set is nearly identical to the one published alongside ODiNPred, but to ensure that there was absolutely no overlap between training and test data, we removed sequences that shared more than 20% percentage pairwise sequence identity to any test set protein.
